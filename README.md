# ARP
Router in Ethernet

When a router needs to send a IP packet over an Ethernet Network, router needs to find out what the MAC addr to send the frame(訊框) to.

Given the DES IP, ARP obtains the DES MAC (this may be from Host or from GW Router).

Host got its ARP table with a list realated to IP addr to MAC addr.
